# CPSC_471_Project
Project developed collaboratively with Hao Nguyen and Jacob Lansang for CPSC 471 at the University of Calgary.

This website runs on localhost (127.0.0.1) using PHP and XAMPP. The website represents a homecare control center for nurses where they can view or edit patients, patient medical histories, doctors, work schedules, questionnaires, reviews and equipment. It also has an API that is run using Node JS. The code can be found under "471_project". Since this was for a class, diagrams were also developed alongside the website which are included under the "Digrams" folder.
